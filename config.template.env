# Thermal Settings
# FAN_MIN sets the minimum PWM speed percentage for the fans.
FAN_MIN="12"                 # Fans will never go below this speed

# CPU Temperature Settings
# Temperature at which CPU fans start ramping up. If FAN_MIN is set above,
# fan speeds will be the higher value of FAN_MIN and calculated curve percentage.
CPU_MIN_TEMP="40"           # Temperature at which CPU fans start ramping up
CPU_MAX_TEMP="75"           # Temperature at which CPU fans reach 100%
CPU_TEMP_FAIL_THRESHOLD="85" # Emergency shutdown temperature for CPU

# GPU Temperature Settings
# Only used if you have a GPU installed. If no GPU is detected,
# all fans will follow CPU temperature settings.
GPU_MIN_TEMP="30"           # Temperature at which GPU fans start ramping up
GPU_MAX_TEMP="75"           # Temperature at which GPU fans reach 100%

# Fan Zone Settings
# Specify which fans are primarily responsible for GPU cooling
# These fans will run faster when GPU needs extra cooling
GPU_FANS="1,2"             # Comma-separated list of fans near the GPU
# Specify which fans are primarily responsible for CPU cooling

# Hysteresis Settings
# Set HYST_COOLING and HYST_WARMING to how many degrees change you want
# before adjusting fan speed. Larger numbers will decrease minor fan changes.
HYST_WARMING="3"            # Degrees increase needed before speeding up fans
HYST_COOLING="4"            # Degrees decrease needed before slowing down fans

# Misc Settings
# How many seconds between temperature checks and fan changes.
LOOP_TIME="10"              # Seconds between checks
# How often to log when system is stable (in cycles)
LOG_FREQUENCY="3"           # Log every X cycles when stable
# Set LOG_FILE location.
LOG_FILE=/var/log/fan_control.log
# Clear log on script start. Set to CLEAR_LOG="y" to enable
CLEAR_LOG="y"
# Enable verbose logging (logs every check). Set to DEBUG="y" to enable
