## What Works

### Core Functionality: 100%

- ✅ **CPU Temperature Monitoring**
  - Multiple CPU detection and monitoring
  - Highest temperature selection for fan control
  - Error handling for sensor failures

- ✅ **GPU Temperature Monitoring**
  - Automatic NVIDIA GPU detection
  - Multiple GPU support
  - Graceful fallback when GPU monitoring fails

- ✅ **Fan Control Algorithm**
  - Linear interpolation between min/max temperature points
  - Minimum fan speed enforcement
  - Hysteresis to prevent oscillation
  - Zone-based cooling for GPU-specific fans

- ✅ **System Integration**
  - Systemd service implementation
  - Automatic startup and shutdown
  - Proper signal handling
  - Default fan control restoration on exit

- ✅ **Configuration System**
  - Environment variable-based configuration
  - Dynamic configuration reloading

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues: None

There are currently no known critical issues that prevent the system from functioning as intended.

### Moderate Issues

1. **Fan Speed Oscillation in Certain Conditions**
   - **Description**: Some users report fan speed oscillation with certain hardware configurations
   - **Workaround**: Increase hysteresis settings (HYST_WARMING and HYST_COOLING)
   - **Status**: Under investigation

2. **iDRAC Credential Security**
   - **Description**: iDRAC credentials stored in plain text configuration file
   - **Workaround**: Ensure restricted file permissions on config.env
   - **Status**: Investigating more secure alternatives

### Minor Issues

1. **Fan Identification Challenges**
   - **Description**: Users have difficulty identifying which fans correspond to which components
   - **Workaround**: Documentation provides general guidance based on common server layouts
   - **Status**: Planning a test mode that cycles through fans individually

2. **Limited GPU Temperature Granularity**
   - **Description**: nvidia-smi provides whole-number temperature readings only
   - **Workaround**: None needed, hysteresis settings compensate for this limitation
   - **Status**: Accepted limitation of nvidia-smi tool

3. **Log File Growth**
   - **Description**: Log files can grow large over time
   - **Workaround**: Manually rotate or delete old logs
   - **Status**: Planning improved log rotation
