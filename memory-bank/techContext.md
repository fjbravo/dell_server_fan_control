   - Lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol
   - Used for remote monitoring of system metrics and status
   - Implemented via mosquitto-clients package
   - Enables integration with various monitoring dashboards and tools

### Supporting Technologies

1. **Shell Utilities**
   - Standard Linux command-line tools (grep, cut, sort, etc.)
   - Used for text processing and data extraction
   - Leveraged for parsing sensor outputs and configuration

2. **syslog**
   - System logging facility
   - Used for persistent logging of fan control activities
   - Provides historical record for troubleshooting

## Development Setup

### Required Packages

- `bash`: Shell interpreter (standard on Linux systems)
- `lm-sensors`: Hardware monitoring package
- `ipmitool`: IPMI management utility
- `nvidia-drivers`: NVIDIA drivers (optional, for GPU monitoring)

### Installation Process

The project includes a comprehensive installation script (`install.sh`) that:
1. Checks for and installs required dependencies
2. Detects hardware capabilities (including NVIDIA GPU presence)
3. Creates necessary directories and files
4. Installs scripts and service definitions
5. Configures initial settings
6. Starts the service

### Development Environment

- Linux-based system (preferably Debian/Ubuntu for testing)
- Access to a Dell PowerEdge server for testing
- iDRAC configuration with IPMI over LAN enabled
- Text editor for script modifications
- Git for version control

## Technical Constraints

### Hardware Constraints

1. **Dell Server Compatibility**
   - Limited to Dell PowerEdge servers with iDRAC
   - Requires IPMI over LAN to be enabled in iDRAC settings
   - Uses Dell-specific IPMI commands that may not work on other server brands

2. **Sensor Availability**
   - Depends on proper functioning of hardware sensors
   - Requires lm-sensors to correctly identify and read CPU temperature sensors
   - GPU monitoring requires compatible NVIDIA GPUs with working drivers

3. **Fan Control Limitations**
   - Cannot control fans more precisely than the PWM percentage allowed by the hardware
   - Some Dell servers may have minimum fan speed thresholds enforced by firmware
   - Fan numbering and placement varies between Dell server models

### Software Constraints

1. **Operating System Requirements**
   - Designed for Linux-based systems
   - Requires systemd for service management
   - Tested primarily on Debian/Ubuntu distributions

2. **Permission Requirements**
   - Requires root/sudo access for:
     - IPMI commands
     - Service installation
     - Configuration in system directories
     - Emergency shutdown capability

3. **Network Requirements**
   - Requires network connectivity to iDRAC interface
   - IPMI over LAN must be properly configured
   - Secure storage of iDRAC credentials needed

### Performance Constraints

1. **Monitoring Frequency**
   - Default 10-second interval between temperature checks
   - More frequent checks increase responsiveness but also system load
   - Less frequent checks reduce system load but may delay response to temperature changes

2. **Hysteresis Requirements**
   - Requires appropriate hysteresis settings to prevent oscillation
   - Too small: may cause rapid fan speed changes
   - Too large: may delay response to temperature changes

## Configuration Parameters

The system is configured through a `config.env` file with the following key parameters:

### iDRAC Settings
- `IDRAC_IP`: IP address of the iDRAC interface
- `IDRAC_USER`: Username for iDRAC authentication
- `IDRAC_PASSWORD`: Password for iDRAC authentication

## Technical Debt and Limitations

1. **Bash Implementation Limitations**
   - Limited error handling capabilities compared to more robust languages
   - No object-oriented features for more structured code
   - Performance overhead of multiple process spawning for command execution

2. **Security Considerations**
   - iDRAC credentials stored in plain text configuration file
   - Root access required for operation

3. **Testing Challenges**
   - Difficult to test without actual Dell server hardware
   - Limited automated testing capabilities
   - Hardware variations between server models may cause unexpected behavior

4. **Potential Improvements**
   - More sophisticated temperature prediction algorithms
   - Support for non-Dell servers with different IPMI implementations
   - More advanced fan curve options (non-linear responses)
   - Web interface for monitoring and configuration
