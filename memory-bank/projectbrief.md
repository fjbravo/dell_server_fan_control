# Project Brief: Dell Server Fan Control

## Project Overview
Dell Server Fan Control is a Linux-based solution that dynamically controls Dell server fans based on CPU and GPU temperatures. It addresses the issue of inadequate fan speed control in Dell servers, which can lead to thermal throttling and potential hardware damage.

## Core Requirements

1. **Temperature Monitoring**
   - Monitor CPU temperatures using lm-sensors
   - Monitor GPU temperatures using nvidia-smi (when available)
   - Support for multiple CPUs and GPUs

2. **Fan Control**
   - Take manual control of Dell server fans via iDRAC IPMI
   - Dynamically adjust fan speeds based on temperature readings
   - Support for different fan zones (CPU and GPU)
   - Implement hysteresis to prevent rapid fan speed changes

3. **Safety Features**
   - Enforce minimum fan speeds to ensure basic cooling
   - Implement emergency shutdown at critical temperatures
   - Gracefully restore Dell's default fan control on exit
   - Handle errors and edge cases safely

4. **Configuration**
   - Allow customization of temperature thresholds
   - Allow customization of fan speed curves
   - Support for GPU-specific fan control
   - Dynamic configuration reloading without service restart

5. **System Integration**
   - Run as a systemd service
   - Proper logging with timestamps
   - Automatic startup after system boot
   - Clean installation and uninstallation

## Target Environment

- Dell PowerEdge servers (tested on R730xd)
- Linux-based operating systems (primarily Debian/Ubuntu)
- Systems with or without NVIDIA GPUs
- Environments where noise and power consumption are concerns

## User Requirements

1. **Ease of Use**
   - Simple installation process
   - Sensible default configuration
   - Clear documentation and logging
   - No need for constant user intervention

2. **Reliability**
   - Stable operation over extended periods
   - Graceful handling of hardware changes
   - Proper error recovery
   - Protection against hardware damage

3. **Flexibility**
   - Support for various server configurations
   - Customizable temperature thresholds and fan curves
   - Optional GPU temperature monitoring
   - Adjustable hysteresis settings

4. **Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Easy access to current status
   - Clear error messages
   - Troubleshooting guidance

## Success Criteria

1. Server temperatures remain within safe operating ranges
2. Fan speeds adjust appropriately to temperature changes
3. System operates quietly during low-load periods
4. Fan speeds increase appropriately during high-load periods
5. No thermal throttling occurs under normal workloads
6. Service reliably starts and stops with the system
7. Configuration changes take effect without service restarts
8. Emergency shutdown occurs before hardware damage can occur
